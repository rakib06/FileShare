To compare two Excel files statistically using Pandas, you can analyze metrics like mean, median, standard deviation, etc., for numerical columns. This approach helps to identify overall differences rather than row-by-row differences. Here’s how to perform a statistical comparison:

Step 1: Import Necessary Libraries

import pandas as pd

Step 2: Read Excel Files

# File paths
file1 = "file1.xlsx"
file2 = "file2.xlsx"

# Read Excel files into DataFrames
df1 = pd.read_excel(file1)
df2 = pd.read_excel(file2)

Step 3: Statistical Summary of Each File

# Get statistical summary
summary1 = df1.describe()
summary2 = df2.describe()

print("Statistical Summary of File 1:")
print(summary1)

print("\nStatistical Summary of File 2:")
print(summary2)

Step 4: Compare Statistical Metrics

You can now compare metrics like mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.

# Compute differences in statistical metrics
stat_diff = summary1 - summary2

print("\nDifferences in Statistical Summary:")
print(stat_diff)

Step 5: Additional Statistical Tests

For a deeper analysis, you can perform statistical tests like t-tests to check for significant differences between columns.

Example: T-Test for Numerical Columns

from scipy.stats import ttest_ind

# Assuming numerical columns are the same in both files
numerical_columns = df1.select_dtypes(include='number').columns

# Perform t-test for each numerical column
t_test_results = {}
for col in numerical_columns:
    stat, p_value = ttest_ind(df1[col].dropna(), df2[col].dropna())
    t_test_results[col] = {"t-statistic": stat, "p-value": p_value}

print("\nT-Test Results:")
for col, result in t_test_results.items():
    print(f"{col}: t-statistic={result['t-statistic']}, p-value={result['p-value']}")

Interpretation:

	•	Descriptive Statistics: The output of .describe() provides a summary of count, mean, std (standard deviation), min, max, etc., for each numerical column.
	•	Difference Calculation: Subtracting the statistical summaries gives insights into how metrics differ between the two files.
	•	T-Test: The t-test checks if there is a significant difference in the means of two independent samples. A p-value less than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference.

Optional Analysis: Correlation Comparison

To check if the correlation between numerical columns differs between the two files:

# Correlation matrices
corr1 = df1.corr()
corr2 = df2.corr()

# Difference in correlation matrices
corr_diff = corr1 - corr2

print("\nDifference in Correlation Matrices:")
print(corr_diff)

Conclusion:

	•	Positive values in stat_diff indicate higher metrics in File 1 compared to File 2.
	•	Negative values indicate lower metrics in File 1.
	•	T-test results help determine if the differences are statistically significant.

This approach provides a comprehensive comparison of the two Excel files based on their statistical properties. Would you like to explore any additional statistical methods or specific tests?
